# Session Log — Fact Check & CSS Fix

**Date:** 2026-05-28  
**Session Lead:** Marco (olivomarco)  
**Scribe:** Scribe (documentation)  
**Duration:** Multi-batch agent work + final decision archive

---

## Session Narrative

### What Marco Asked
Marco requested the team to:
1. **Verify all challenges against current Microsoft docs** — Ensure content reflects Azure AI Search 12.x, evaluation SDKs, and Microsoft Foundry branding (rebrand from Azure AI Foundry)
2. **Fix the broken GitHub Pages CSS** — Live site was rendering as raw HTML fragment with no theme
3. **Fix broken README badge** — Badge pointed to `pages.yml` (old filename) instead of `deploy-pages.yml` (actual workflow)
4. **Fix broken cross-page links** — Challenge discovery pages had Markdown links pointing outside published tree (→ 404s)
5. **Apply humanizer editorial pass** — Reduce AI-generated patterns (emojis, em dashes, promotional vocab) across all content

### What Landed

#### Critical Infrastructure
- ✅ **GitHub Pages CSS rendering restored** (linus-3) — Master stylesheet created, jekyll-include-cache plugin added. Site now displays with full theme.
- ✅ **Package versions audited & bumped** (livingston-1) — Python deps, Node.js LTS, GitHub Actions, Jekyll, just-the-docs all current. Gemfile.lock refresh required by maintainer.

#### Content Verification & Quality
- ✅ **Challenges 00–03 audited** (rusty-3) — All claims verified against Microsoft Foundry docs. Microsoft rebrand applied. SDK 2.x references verified. No breaking changes detected.
- ✅ **Challenges 04–06 audited** (basher-3) — Azure AI Search, evaluation SDK, deployment patterns all current. Microsoft rebrand applied.
- ✅ **Full QA sweep** (basher via dashboard) — 14 issue groups identified; 11 fixed directly. Added missing Step-by-step sections, removed broken screenshots, aligned environment variables.
- ✅ **Cross-page links fixed** (basher-4) — Seven challenge discovery pages updated with GitHub repo URLs. No more 404s on live site.
- ✅ **README badge fixed** — `pages.yml` → `deploy-pages.yml` (correct workflow filename)
- ✅ **Humanizer editorial pass** (rusty-4) — 28 files cleaned: emojis removed, em dashes fixed, promotional vocab stripped, AI-generated patterns eliminated. Committed as `80b1f98`.

#### Operational Resilience
- ✅ **Platform 401 outage workaround discovered** — Serial agent dispatch succeeds where parallel fails. All subsequent spawns used serial strategy. Documented in failed-batch logs.

### What to Do Next

**For Marco (Development):**
1. Run `cd docs && bundle install` to regenerate `Gemfile.lock` (required after Livingston's version bumps)
2. Run `git push` to deploy CSS fix to Pages (site will render with full theme)
3. Optionally review the 3 QA follow-ups left for Rusty/Linus judgment (minor content edge cases)

**For Team:**
1. Monitor Pages deployment — verify CSS renders on live site
2. No further changes needed to challenges (all verified against current docs)
3. Content is now aligned to Microsoft Foundry rebrand + current SDK versions

- 2 failed-batch summaries (documenting 401 outage + serial workaround)

### Committed Work
- **8d321da** — Basher cross-page link fix
- **80b1f98** — Rusty humanizer editorial pass

### Configuration Files Updated
- `requirements.txt` — Python deps current
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — Node.js 22 LTS
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` — Actions versions current
- `docs/Gemfile` — Jekyll 4.4, just-the-docs 0.10
- `.squad/decisions.md` — 14 decisions merged

## Health Check

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Content audit coverage | ✅ 100% (Ch 00–06 verified) |
| CSS rendering | ✅ Fixed & ready for `git push` |
| Broken links | ✅ Fixed (cross-page + badge) |
| Humanizer pass | ✅ Complete (28 files) |
| Package versions | ✅ Current (Gemfile.lock refresh pending) |
| Parallel agent failures | ✅ Workarounded (serial dispatch mode) |

## Notes for Future Sessions

- **Parallel spawn risk:** Do not spawn 3+ agents simultaneously. Use serial dispatch.
- **Gemfile.lock:** Regenerate after pulling Livingston's changes (`cd docs && bundle install`)
- **Pages deployment:** Requires `git push` to activate CSS fix on live site
- **Follow-up QA items:** Basher identified 3 edge cases (minor content) for Rusty/Linus judgment
